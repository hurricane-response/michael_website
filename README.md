## Configuration

New pages created with the `default` layout type will automatically appear on the home page under the Get Help section.

A separate collection for states also dynamically generated appears below.



## Known issues

See our [open issues](https://github.com/hurricane-response/michael_website/issues)

**Note:** Mapbox donates their product to us for free for volunteer projects only -- if the project ends up getting adopted by a government partner or somehow turns into a commercial project, we'll have to plan a transition to a different Mapbox account.

## Getting involved

Our [getting started](https://bit.ly/2N6YVYD) document serves as the best entry for the project for all types of contributions.
